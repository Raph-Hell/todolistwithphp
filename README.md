# todolistwithphp
A simple Todo List.

LANGUAGES USED
MYSQL(mariaDB)
PHP
HTML5 &
CSS3.

No Javascript was used. I did that intentionally to prove to other developers who hates PHP how fun and interesting working with PHP can be ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹.


TO USE
1. Go to XAMPP's phpmyadmin,
2. Create a database named "todo"
3. Inside the "todo" database, create a table named "todo"
4. Create two columns namely "id" and "todo_items" in the "todo" table.

After you're through with the above steps you're all set to use the TODO APP.
